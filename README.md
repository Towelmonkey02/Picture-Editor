# Picture-Editor 

### Implemented in C++ 

### Usage: `./analyser [source picture] [destination output] [p | t] [g | r | d]`

A program to do some basic image parsing and binary-transcribing on **.bmp** files.

I got a bit lazy to implement the other image operations, may do this in the future.

---

1. [p] [g]: **Greyscale** operation, converts picture to greyscale.
2. [p] [r]: **Reflect** option, reflects picture vertically.
3. [t]: **Transcribes** the file directly into hexadecimal data.
4. [t] [d]: **Debug mode:** Additionally parses and processes the BMP file header into a readable format.
